slash: Symptomatic Lazy Assed Shell

"Don't Reinvent The Wheel". Amen.
I say, don't do it unless you want to learn something.
Shell are fun. Bash is fun. Bash learning curve is pretty logarithmic: 
  - Novice level is reache in no time. 
  - Advanced level in time. Expert level tekes way more time. 
  - Guru level, I couldn't tell.

Slash is an attempt to add more cool features to Bash while broadening my knowledge on the shell.
Noticeable features I have added so far are:
  - Library Testing framework
  - Function decorator.

Development is still at an early stage, no clear specs have been defined, they come when I feel 
features might be interesting to add to Bash, or simply fun.

Maybe one day it will become a useful reference for other lazy devs. Or not.
