# SLASH: a Symptomatic Lazy Assed Shell

# ########################################

"Do Not Reinvent The Wheel".
Amen. Yes. Well. You see. I tend to avoid generalities. I'd rather say: do not do it unless you want to learn something.

Shells are fun. Bash is fun. Bash learning curve has seemed pretty logarithmic to me: 
  - Novice level is reached in no time. 
  - Advanced level in time.
  - Expert level takes way more time. I might be reaching it.
  - Guru level, well I couldn't tell.

Slash is an attempt to add cool features and functions to Bash while broadening my knowledge on the shell.
Shell scripting requires extra caution with syntax, tends to be ugly, leads to non-reusable spaghetti code.
Slash tries to emphasize on readable code syntax, modulariy and unit testing.

Development is still at an early stage, no clear specs have been defined, they come when I feel 
features might be interesting to be added to Bash, or simply fun.

Once in a while, I stop what I'm shelling about and I think: "Mmm, right now I would love to be able to 
do this and that, with bash". Sometimes simply choosing to use another language is more relevant. 
Maybe Korn shell does it, Yes. Surely I could also write my own shell in C. Certainly. 

But. What if. What if those features were implemented in Bash?
Wouldn't that be aaaawesome and add more power and flexibility to it? 

Noticeable features I have added so far are:
  - Library Testing framework
  - Function decorator.


Learning, challenge, puzzle, whims, symptomatic whims, lazy, ass, lazy assed. Such is the way this slash repository shall be defined.
