slash: Symptomatic Lazy Assed Shell

"Don't Reinvent The Wheel". Amen.
I say, don't do it unless you want to learn something.
Shell are fun. Bash is fun. Bash learning curve is pretty logarithmic to my finding: 
  - Novice level is reached in no time. 
  - Advanced level in time. 
  - Expert level takes way more time. 
  - Guru level, well I couldn't tell. But I'd like to be able to!

Slash is an attempt to add more cool features to Bash while broadening my knowledge of it.
Noticeable features I have added so far are:
  - Library Testing framework
  - Function decorator.

Development is still at an early stage, no clear specs nor scheduling have been defined, they come when I feel 
features might be interesting or fun to add to Bash while tweeking with automated configurations and writing scripts.

Maybe one day it will become a useful reference for other lazy devs. Or not.
